Authors@R: 
    c(person(given = "Stefano",
             family = "Coretta",

Description: Provides functions that compute predictions from Generalised
    Additive Models (GAMs) fitted with 'mgcv' and return them as a tibble.
    These can be plotted with a generic plot()-method that uses 'ggplot2' or
    plotted as any other data frame. The main function is predict_gam().
